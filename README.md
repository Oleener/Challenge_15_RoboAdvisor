This activity first configures the initial robo advisor by Defineing an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement, Then I Build and test the robo advisor by Makeing sure that the bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user, lastly I Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function by Createing an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.
